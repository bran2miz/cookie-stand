Reflections and Comments

This project was not easy, but I am thrilled that everything is working perfectly! Initially, once Sheyna had told us that we were supposed to create new DOM elements, I was very hesitant because I didn't want to break my code. However, I was pleased that implementing them within my JavaScript was very simple, but also cleared up a lot of excess code that I had.

After completing Salmon Cookies, I definitely have found myself thinking that maybe I do know more than I actually think I do. Initially when given this assignment I truly believed that this would have taken me forever. However, I think that it took me perhaps 12 hours total from the start of lab 7 -lab 10 to complete this.
